# 2048 while Claude thinks

A tiny terminal game that pops up automatically while [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
is busy thinking, so you stop drifting off to Twitter.

When you submit a prompt, a new Terminal window appears after a short delay with
a `curses`-based 2048 board. When Claude finishes its turn, the window closes
itself and brings focus back to your main terminal.

```

## How it works

Three Claude Code hooks are wired into `~/.claude/settings.json`:

| Event              | Script          | What it does                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `launch.sh`     | Schedules a new Terminal window with 2048 to open after a 3-second delay.                                                 |
| `Notification`     | `attention.sh`  | Claude is waiting on you (permission prompt, question, idle). Flips the game into a full-screen "needs input" banner and pings a macOS notification. |
| `Stop`             | `stop.sh`       | Cancels the pending launch (if Claude was fast) and closes the game window.                                               |

The 3-second delay means short responses don't cause a window to flicker open
and shut. While the banner is up, any keystroke closes the game window so
focus returns to your main terminal. State (pending PID, window title,
attention flag) is tracked in `/tmp/claude-2048/`.

## Requirements

- macOS (uses AppleScript via `osascript` to drive Apple Terminal)
- Python 3 (ships with macOS at `/usr/bin/python3`)
- Claude Code CLI installed and run from Apple Terminal

> The current launcher targets `Terminal.app`. iTerm2 isn't supported out of
> the box but the `osascript` block in `launch.sh` and `stop.sh` is the only
> thing you'd need to swap.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hexshire/claude-2048.git
cd claude-2048
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` is idempotent:

- Copies `2048.py`, `launch.sh`, `stop.sh` to `~/.claude/games/`
- Adds the two hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json` (skips if already present)

Start a new Claude Code session and send any prompt that takes more than a few
seconds. A new Terminal window should pop up with the game.

> The first time AppleScript opens a Terminal window, macOS may ask for
> permission to control Terminal. Approve it once and you're set.

## Usage

| Key                       | Action                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `←` `↑` `→` `↓`           | Move tiles                      |
| `h` `j` `k` `l`           | Move tiles (vim-style)          |
| `w` `a` `s` `d`           | Move tiles (gamer-style)        |
| `r`                       | Restart the board               |
| `q` or `Esc`              | Quit                            |

Your best score is persisted in `~/.claude/games/.2048_highscore`.

## Disable temporarily

Set an environment variable in the shell where you run `claude`:

```sh
export CLAUDE_NO_GAME=1
claude
```

The launcher exits early when this is set, so no window opens.

## Uninstall

```sh
./uninstall.sh
```

This removes the hook entries from `~/.claude/settings.json`, deletes
`~/.claude/games/`, and cleans up `/tmp/claude-2048/`.

## File layout

```

## Customizing

- **Delay before launch.** Edit `DELAY_SECONDS` at the top of `launch.sh`.
- **Window position / size.** Tweak `set bounds of front window` inside the
  `osascript` block in `launch.sh`.
- **Board size.** Change `SIZE` near the top of `2048.py` (4 by default).
- **Colors.** Reorder `PALETTE` in `2048.py`.
